## Apologies
When I first created this plugin, the phrase "Make XXX Great Again" was a newly formed trope and, at the time, I was unable to foresee what it would come to represent. Knowing what I know now, I genuinely regret choosing this name and, in some small way, implicitly supporting this phrase and everything it has come to represent. I plan on renaming this plugin as soon as practical. 

## Make The Mac Great Again
This is a simple Xcode plugin that always make sure that the OS X templates are at the top of the list
when creating new files or projects.
